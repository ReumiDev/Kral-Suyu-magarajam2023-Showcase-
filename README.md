Portfolio Showcase: 'Kral Suyu' for #magarajam2023

> This is a portfolio showcase for "Kral Suyu," a game I helped produce as part of a team, under the name 'KEI Studios'. 

## About The Game 
Kral Suyu was made for #magarajam2023.

Theme: Mysterious Machine

Kerem, who constantly clashes with his girlfriend Şehnaz, feels lost and full of regret after she puts him in his place. His only wish is to go to the past and change what happened. When he settles into his late grandfather Ertan's house, he suddenly remembers the room his grandfather never allowed him to enter. Kerem starts to search for the key, thinking, 'What would happen if I went in? He's dead anyway.' When he finds the key, he excitedly opens the door to that room and experiences the strangest day of his life.
